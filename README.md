# Hate-Speech-Detection-NLP-Deep-Learning-
In this project, I used the Hate Speech and Offensive Language Dataset from Kaggle (24,783 labeled tweets) to build text classification models for detecting hate speech and offensive content. The dataset includes three classes: hate speech, offensive language, and neither. I applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text preprocessing and feature extraction, and implemented three classification approaches: Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The project compares traditional machine learning methods with deep learning models for multi-class text classification.
